## Why did we create Penguin Master? 

I mean... who doesn't want to know about penguins? Honestly. 

## Gulp tasks used for working on this project

* The gulp task 'styles' performs the following two tasks:

1. gulp 'sass': takes .scss files - imported into styles.scss - and converts them to styles.css
2. gulp 'minify-css' minifies css files to .min.css

* gulp 'watch' monitors changes in the .scss files and runs the gulp 'styles' automatically

* The gulp task 'scripts' performs the following two tasks:

1. gulp 'combine js': concatenates our .js files to a single .js file
2. gulp 'minify-css' minifies this js file to .min.js file
